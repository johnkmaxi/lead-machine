# Lead Machine

Lead machine is a program for finding information about properties listed on the
MLS. The parts of the lead machine are a Crawler, an Analyzer, and a DB.
Together, these parts accept a variety of data sources from which they obtain
the necessary information, store it, analyze it, and output a list of properties
and the contact information for each property. This list acts as a daily to-do
list for driving wholesaling KPIs.

Identified sources include:
- Realtor-created MLS search portal
- Zillow
- Realtor.com
- Redfin
